* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - NPM is a package manager for node.js. Follow the [Linode](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs/) guide if you're lost.
* [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/quasar-cli/installation) - Quasar CLI will help you setup the quasar framework and VueJS for your project. It will also help you to quickly run the hot-reloading server and when the time comes, to build production, webpacked versions of your projects.
